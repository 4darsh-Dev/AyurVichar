# AyurVichar - Ayurvedic Prakruti Assessment
A web platform for finding prakruti (phenotype) of individuals, suggesting food and lifestyle rules, regulations for a healthy balanced life.. 

## ðŸš€ Problem Statement

Ayurveda's individualized healthcare system categorizes individuals into distinct 'Prakruti' types based on their unique constitution, which influences disease predisposition and dietary preferences. 

## ðŸ’¡ Solution / Idea
Current Prakruti assessment methods are cumbersome and involve in-person consultations. To streamline this process, we propose creating an AI-powered chatbot with a pre-recorded questionnaire for convenient Prakruti assessment, reducing the need for physical visits and long questionnaires.


## Possibilites
- Rules and regulations to be followed for healthy lifestyle according Individual prakriti
- Pre-diagnosis of Diseases before according to Ayurvedic principles
